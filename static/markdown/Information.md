## <h3 style="color: #FF6025;">About the Project</h3>

***Echo Speaks*** is a utilitarian smartapp and device handler that allows you to discover, select, and use the Amazon Alexa Devices directly in your Smart Home Environment.
It will give you the ability to wake your Alexa devices remotely to speak any text that you wish for almost any given scenario.
Gone are the days of using expensive speakers connected to your hub. The day that
you have all been waiting for has arrived.
